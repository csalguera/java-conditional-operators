     * Introduction to Conditional Operators
     * -------------------------------------
     * 
     * Java includes operators that only use boolean values
     * 
     * These conditional operators help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: true or false
     * 
     * If we want to run a code block if multiple conditions are true, we use the AND operator: &&
     * If we want to run a code block if at least one condition is true, we use the OR operator: ||
     * We can produce the opposite value by using the NOT operator: ! (also referred to as the Bang operator)
